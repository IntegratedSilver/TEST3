### Things I want to do
- Set up backend to save user login info, save game data, and load game data
- Have pages for Login, Dashboard, Console Select, Game Select, the Emulator Page, About Page, Credit Page
- Set up a Router to go between the pages

### Main Focus ATM
- Set up GameBoy Emulator to load and run a game smoothly (Success)
- Set up dummy layout for emulator page
- Set up Game Select page so the user can click on a GameBoy/Color game and it takes them to the emulator that has the respective game loaded
